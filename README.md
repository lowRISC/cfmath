# CfMath: Constant Function Implementations of Mathematical Functions for HDL Elaboration

This package contains a collection of mathematical functions that are commonly used when defining
the value of constants in HDL code.  These functions are implemented as Verilog constants functions.
Introduced in Verilog 2001 (IEEE Std 1364-2001), a constant function (ยง 10.3.5) is a function whose
value can be evaluated at compile time or during elaboration.  A constant function must be called
with arguments that are constants.
